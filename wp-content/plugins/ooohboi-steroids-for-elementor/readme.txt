Boost your Elementor with some fresh and yet innovative options.

== Description ==

An awesome set of tools, options and settings that expand Elementor defaults. Instead of creating new Elementor Widgets, these act like an upgrade of existing options or the self-standing panels thing. 

= What is new? =

BULLET - You can now move the bullet of the Icon List widget to the top which is useful when the amount of text exceeds one line only. 
A little but handy option has been added to the HARAKIRI extension which allows you to cut off the bottom margin of the Text Editor widget's last paragraph.

= In the package so far =

1. HARAKIRI 
Allows you to change the writing mode (CSS property writing-mode) of Elementor's Heading and Text Editor widgets.

2. POOPART
Add an overlay or underlay ghost-element to any Elementor Widget. By adding a mask image to these, and/or combining them with CSS filters, blend mode, a wow effect is inevitable. Oh, yes, you can also resize and reposition these if you like.

3. OVERLAIZ
From now on, you can move the Background Overlay in any direction, as well as to resize it. Creating overlapping columns is now piece of cake.

4. PAGININI
Your frustration with styling up the posts pagination in Elementor is now officially over.

13. PERSPEKTIVE
A small set of options that allow you to move widgets in 3D space

14. SHADOUGH
This extension allows you to create the shadow that conforms the shape.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use OoohBoi Steroids? =

It depends on the widgets that you are editing. For example, if you are about to style Heading widget or Text Editor widget, HARAKIRI options will show up.
All the POOPART options can be found under "Advanced" tab, POOPART panel.
Rest assured, you won't miss them because there will always be an eye-catching icon next to the set of options (or the panel title).

= Do I need Elementor PRO with this add-on? =

No, you don't. It'll work with both free version of Elementor and Elementor PRO.
