Allow customers to buy a subscription product for someone else with WooCommerce Subscriptions.

# WooCommerce Subscriptions Gifting

[WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://www.woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) makes it possible to offer subscription products in your WooCommerce store.

But what happens if a customer wants to purchase a subscription for someone else?

They could enter the recipient's shipping address for physical products to make sure they receive packages, but what about virtual products, like memberships? And what happens if the recipient moves before the subscription ends, how do they update their shipping address?

WooCommerce Subscriptions Gifting solves these issues and many more, by making it possible for one person to purchase a subscription product for someone else. It then shares the subscription between the purchaser and recipient.

Whether customers are adding products to their cart from the single product page, reviewing their cart or checking out, customers can choose to purchase subscriptions for others by entering the recipient's email address. WooCommerce Subscriptions Gifting will take care of the rest.


== Installation ==

To install Gifting:

1. Download the latest version of the plugin
1. Go to **Plugins > Add New > Upload** administration screen on your WordPress site
1. Select the ZIP file you just downloaded
1. Click **Install Now**
1. Click **Activate**

After installation, you can customise the way Gifting works by going to **WooCommerce > Settings > Subscriptions** and scrolling down to **Gifting Subscriptions**.
Here you can:
- Customise the label text displayed next to the checkbox on the [Single Product, Cart and Checkout pages](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-subscriptions-gifting#customers-view). By default, the text will display "This is a gift", but you may change this to a phrase which suits your store.
- Enable or disable granting dual download permissions for downloadable subscription purchases. Learn more about this setting in the [Downloadable Products section](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-subscriptions-gifting#downloadable-products). By default, this feature is disabled.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can gifting be used for Corporate Purchasing? =

Yes. As well as purchasing gifts for family and friends, Gifting's underlying logic is also suited to corporate purchasing scenarios. If your store revolves around selling corporate products, it's likely a company purchasing officer may wish to buy and manage subscriptions for members of their team. It is for this reason when communicating with the purchaser and recipient, more generic terminology, like  _"Recipient"_, and generic phrases, like _"purchased a subscription for you"_, are used so that Gifting can be applied in corporate purchasing scenarios with very little customisation required.

= From which pages can a customer purchase a subscription product for someone else? =

There are three pages where a customer can choose to purchase a subscription product for someone else:

* Single Product Page
* Cart Page
* Checkout Page

= Does Gifting integrate with WooCommerce Memberships? =

If your store makes use of the WooCommerce Subscriptions and [WooCommerce Memberships](http://www.woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-memberships/) plugins the ability to purchase membership subscriptions is important. Which is why we have made sure we integrate with WooCommerce Memberships.

In a nutshell, gift recipients who are purchased a subscription product tied to a membership plan will receive the benefits of the membership rather than the purchaser. All the features of managing the memberships granted through gifted subscriptions remain intact, you can pause, edit, cancel and delete memberships granted to recipients just as normal through the **WooCommerce > Memberships** page.
